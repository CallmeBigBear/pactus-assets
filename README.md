### TestNet

Other networks, such as Phoenix test network assets can be found in their specific directory, containing the accounts, and validators files beside their readme and docs.

For example, you can find Phoenix testnet assets [here](./phoenix).

## Contribution

Please make sure you are adding a famous or well-known address and assets. make sure you are following the correct JSON format.

## Usage

You can use these assets to show name, logo, and link instead of only the address on your service such as Explorer etc.
For example, you can use [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PACZone/pactus-assets/main/address.json), to get all mainnet accounts listed here with metadata.
